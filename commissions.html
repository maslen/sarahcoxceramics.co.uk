        <p>Sarah is happy to undertake private commissions. Please contact Sarah to create a unique piece for yourself or your loved ones. Commissions take 4-8 weeks from start to finish, depending on scale, and other work in progress.</p>

        <p>Sarah has undertaken many unique commissions ranging from a squid sculpture for a marine biologist from Cape Cod USA, to sixty four pieces for a hotel in the British Virgin Islands. She has also sculpted client's pets, made large frost proof palm trees with Blue Birds flying over for a client's garden, and a patinated copper effect Mother Elephant Bathing her Baby, water feature for a client to match the copper roof of their unusual home.</p>
